Spies! is a 4-player LAN experience.

You'll be randomly tasked with either protecting your teammates or betraying them. Kill the "Traitor" before he kills you, and the good guys win!

Q: How do you figure out who the Traitor is?

A: Everyone has a piece of Intel describing the appearance of the Traitor. Piece your clues together to determine his identity!

You can quickly start playing by either hosting a game or locating a friend's game through the server browser.

You have 5 abilities:

1. Chat - Request to chat privately with a nearby player
2. Shoot - Kill a nearby player. You have one bullet only!
3. Sleep - Tranquilize a nearby player. You have one dart only!
4. Search - Loot a dead or unconscious player. Confiscate their Intel
	IMPORTANT - Traitors can also confiscate Bullets and Darts!
5. Intel - View your intel on the Traitor and check ammunition

Use these abilities by clicking the button on screen or pressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on your keyboard.
