Thank you for testing Agents!

At this stage you must set up a session manually. This game requires exactly four players.
Start by launching the application and pressing the Create button to start a server.
Have three other players enter your public IP address into the address bar.
When they click Join, they should appear on the map with you.
When a game ends, you must click the Exit button to end the session and then repeat the previous steps to start another game.

At the top of the game screen is your objective. 
One of your peers - the Traitor - will be instructed to kill the other players.
The game ends when the traitor is killed - or if the traitor succeeds in killing everyone.

Q: How do you figure out who the Traitor is?
A: Everyone has a piece of Intel describing the appearance of the Traitor.
Piece your clues together to determine his identity.

You have 5 abilities:

1. Chat - Request to chat privately with a nearby player
2. Shoot - Kill a nearby player. You have one bullet only!
3. Sleep - Tranquilize a nearby player. You have one dart only!
4. Search - Loot a dead or unconscious player. Confiscate their Intel
	IMPORTANT - Traitors can also confiscate Bullets and Darts!
5. Intel - View your intel on the Traitor and check ammunition

Use these abilities by clicking the button on screen or pressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 on your keyboard.
